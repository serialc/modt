# MOD-t
A description of modifications and slicer settings to get the 2015 MOD-t 3D printer by New Matter functioning. 

I am putting my MOD-t in storage and creating this record in case I need to get the printer functioning again - or perhaps it helps someone else.

The MOD-t is a low-cost 3D printer but it can still produce good quality prints. My printer has only ever printed about 2.5 Kg of filament. The main problem encountered after about 1.5 Kg was the deformation of the [PTFE liner](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend). Following the [directions provided by mattcrichards](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/wiki) I was able to replace my hot end (with some [adaptations](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/issues/1))to produce higher quality prints and increase its reliability.

There are many instructions online regarding which version of Cura to use to slice models - particularly those stipulating an old version. I've been much happier with the print quality using the latest Ultimaker Cura version.

See the various Cura settings files in the folder and those suggested by others in links below.
