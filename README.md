# MOD-t
A description of modifications and slicer settings to get the 2015 MOD-t 3D printer by New Matter functioning. 

I am putting my MOD-t in storage and creating this in case I need to get the printer functioning again.

The MOD-t is a low-cost 3D printer but it can still produce good quality prints. My printer has only ever printed about 2.5 Kg of filament. The main problem encountered after about 1.5 Kg was the deformation of the [PTFE liner](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend). Followin the [directions provided by mattcrichards](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/wiki) I was able to replace my hot end (with some [adaptations](https://github.com/mattcrichards/modthotend/issues/1))to produce higher quality prints and increased reliability.

There are many instrustions online regarding which version of Cura to use to slice models - particularly those stipulating an old version. I've been much happier with the print quality of the latest Ultimaker Cura version.

See the settings files in the folder.
